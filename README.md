# Finding & Retaining Talent {#finding-retaining-talent}
###A guide to finding, hiring, and retaining data talent

##**_Focus on data people._**
You don’t need computer scientists to build government apps or to try new technologies and development tactics. Similarly, you don’t need data scientists or statisticians to develop your team’s analytic capabilities and abilities -- but you do need to find and/or hire people with the basic skills to take on this kind of work, if your goal is to use data and tech in service of your community.

The question becomes: Where do you look, and who do you look for? Internally, can you find staff who might be able to take on data work? Externally, how do you attract people who otherwise wouldn’t think to work in government? Moreover, once you’ve built your team, how do you retain those team members?

##**Who are the ‘data people’?**

Think of the ‘data people’ as anyone with interest in understanding what’s happening in your organization (or the world) using quantifiable information. (This isn’t to say that behavioral interviews, textual analysis of written commentary, and verbal feedback aren’t quantifiable, but the discussion for qualitative versus quantitative is for another time.)

Data people do include analysts, number-crunchers, and budget people. But they also include GIS experts working with geospatial data, anyone who creates infographics, journalists, and storytellers.

Data people may not have a policy background and that is okay.

Data people may not have an accounting or statistics background and that is okay.

Data people may not have a technical background and that is also okay.

Policy, statistics, data science, and technical skills can all be learned. What’s important when looking for these resources, first and foremost, is interest.

##**Who are the ‘tech people’?**

Tech people are not necessarily your IT staff. In fact, they probably shouldn’t be your IT staff, who are likely overworked and under-resourced as it is. Moreover, there is a distinct difference between a technologist who works with data and uses code to build tools and an IT expert whose wheelhouse is likely hardware and systems administration.

Like data people, tech people come from a variety of professional backgrounds that go beyond computer science. You should look for people who self-identify as developers, either front-end (the stuff users see), back-end (the stuff that makes the stuff users see function), or full-stack (the unicorns who do it all). User experience and visual designers are often tech people. The same is true for digital cartographers, multimedia producers, and of course, data scientists.

Tech people may also not have backgrounds in policy, statistics, or data, and that is okay. As with data people, the key factor is interest -- everything else can be learned.

There can be a fair amount of overlap between data and tech people, but someone who would self-identify as a ‘data person’ probably approaches a given project from a different angle than someone who calls herself a ‘tech person.’

##**Where to find data & tech talent**

###**In House**

Take a look at your existing staff and see if there are any obvious uses of data already in place. Who’s producing your maps, budgets, charts, and tables? Those people are already tapping into data sources to create a new product.

You may find that there are people with an interest or aptitude for what you need among people responsible for mapping (GIS), 311 operations, budgets, communications, or project management. If your government has invested in innovations fellowships or anything comparable, those individuals may also be a rich resource for talent.

*   **GIS:** GIS staffers are already accustomed to working with data and the technology that drives map production. These skills can be redirected or built upon to support open data, data visualization, and other data science work.

*   **311 (or other customer service office that collects data):** People who deal with residents in your jurisdiction are likely to have a vested interest in understanding, from a data perspective, the work that they do. Sometimes even a cursory look at 311 data can lead to insights that increase efficiencies in a call center and in responses to those calls.

*   **Budgets:** The people who write the budgets in your government are used to dealing with numbers, spreadsheets, and analyses of what it all means. They may be open to learning new tools and data skills that can increase their efficiencies in writing budgets, ultimately making that process smoother and less painful.

*   **Communications:** Communications teams in your government may be responsible for the city’s web presence, social media, and other external-facing communications. Here’s a great place to tap any journalism and storytelling skills as they relate to data. Is anyone on this team producing infographics or public reports?

*   **Fellowships & Innovations Offices:** These jobs exist specifically to try new techniques and to do government work in a non-governmental fashion. These people may already have the data skills you’re looking for and/or the willingness to learn them.

*   **Interns:** If you’re looking for something to give your intern to do, data work may be the place to start. Assuming your interns are young (in high school or college), they’re probably already comfortable with technology and may appreciate being given a technical data challenge -- especially if the end result has a measurable impact.

###**On gauging interest internally:**

If you want to get a sense for who would be interested in doing data work, there are a few ways to gauge interest.

*   **An online survey:** You can use free tools like SurveyMonkey and Typeform, emailed to everyone you think might be interested. Ask about level of interest, time they’re willing to commit, and previous experience with data. Make sure to collect their email addresses. This is probably the simplest and most expeditious way to gauge interest, but beware that you have have trouble getting responses to _any_ online survey. A little incentive for completing a survey doesn’t hurt.

*   **Lunch and learn:** Nothing fancy here -- all you have to do is find a space. Invite your organization to hear a quick talk about data and how you’re hoping to use it during lunch. Try an [Ignite](http://www.ignitetalks.io/) format -- 5 minutes, 20 slides -- and leave the rest of the time open for conversation. As with the survey, collect email addresses! Free food is always good incentive, but if you can’t swing that, remind participants to bring their own.

*   **Start small and call for volunteers.** If you have a small, non-mission-critical data project, see who responds to a call for volunteers to work on it. You might also consider encouraging people in your organization to go to a local civic hack night. [Find one here.](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/)

###**Externally**

Break the mold! Don’t go looking for new government staff at public policy schools. If you want to hire tech and data specialists to do work beyond standard analysis, check out these other places where people learn how to use data and build tools:

*   **Information science / information architecture programs:** It’s literally in the name -- these programs teach people to handle information and data, and you may find that graduates are interested in applying those skills for the greater good.

*   **Journalism schools and digital newsrooms:** J-schools are increasingly teaching data journalism and data visualization as part of the core curricula. These skills transfer into government. You may also find good people in digital newsrooms, many of which are actively doing data science in the name of storytelling.

*   **Civic technology volunteer groups:** These groups, like Code for America’s Brigades and other civic hack nights, are full of people who are already doing some of the work you’re interested in, and would likely be very excited to find a way to do it formally.

##**How to attract and hire the talent you want**

There are a pair of challenges to building any new team within government: the anticipated retirement of a sizeable chunk of the existing labor force and the difficulty of attracting young employees to government.

Traditionally, people would come to government for job security and retirement benefits, offsetting the pay cut that comes with the territory. Today, those benefits are less readily available and private industry -- especially in the startup/tech sectors -- is more attractive than ever, with comparatively excellent pay and benefits.

The common wisdom is that it’s difficult to entice people to government (local or otherwise) because the pay simply can’t keep up -- but it turns out that money isn’t the only, or even the biggest, motivator for people when they’re looking for work. This is particularly true of millennials, who tend to be motivated more by a desire to do meaningful work, as well as by the type of work environment they’re exposed to.

Possibly the biggest blocker to attracting young talent to government is the opacity of hiring practices, combined with an exceptionally long wait time between an applicant’s submission, and hearing back from a hiring manager. This alone deters many potential government employees, who literally cannot afford to wait six months or a year to hear back _anything_ from a position they’ve applied to.

They’re also likely applying to multiple positions simultaneously. This means that even if your position is a number-one choice, you’ll lose out to other organizations that are more responsive and transparent in their application processes.

So, if you can’t offer private-sector pay and perks, or promise traditional government security and longevity, how do you entice people to join your team?

*   **Write better job descriptions.** Understand what you really need for the position you’re trying to hire and write the description accordingly. Don’t make the mistake of requiring that a data scientist _also_ be a communications specialist _and_ an expert programmer _and...and...and…_ This has the effect of diluting the quality of candidates who will apply, not to mention overwork the successful candidate -- making her harder to retain.

Make a clear distinction between the skills and experience that are absolutely _required_ to do the job you’re asking and those that simply would be nice. For example, is it absolutely necessary to require a computer or information science degree, or would a few years of experience suffice?

This is particularly true for technical positions. You don’t need a computer science degree to be an excellent developer, and listing one as a requirement could cost you qualified applicants.

*   **Improve the transparency and responsiveness of your hiring practices.** Be open from the start with what your process looks like, even if it’s not ideal. Is it going to take six months to make a hire? Say so. Does your process include panel interviews, written tests, or code challenges? Say so.

Understanding that changing hiring processes to be faster or more transparent may take months itself, look for ways to indicate to candidates that their applications haven’t been lost in the ether. This means more than an automatically generated email. If there’s someone you’re interested, a quick, personal message explaining your process can go a long way.

In the longer term, are there ways that you can expedite applications? Are there review steps that can be removed or approvals that aren’t really necessary? Is there a way to front-load administrative requirements for hiring, so that candidates in your pipeline are shielded from it?

It may also be important to communicate any changes you’re making to your hiring process, in the hopes of attracting return applicants.

*   **Look for alternative benefits or perks as motivators.** If you can’t offer pay competitive to the private sector, what can you offer? Think about ‘soft benefits’ like an excellent workplace culture, a central work location, flexible schedules, or telecommute benefits, conference attendance, and training opportunities.

*   **Appeal to people’s sense of service.** You may be surprised to find that the opportunity to serve their community or improve their government is a heady incentive for civic work.

*   **Don’t expect to hold on to people forever.** The days of someone staying in a job for 30 years are over. While some people may stay for a few years or a decade, that’s increasingly rare, so accept that people will leave after a shorter amount of time and prepare for it. Make documentation a part of every job and work to preserve institutional knowledge. When someone on your team is ready to move on, offer support.

*   **Improve your onboarding.** Reduce frustration as much as you can by putting that aforementioned institutional knowledge to work and make these resources available to new hires immediately. Be transparent about interpersonal and political challenges in your office as much as you can be.

*   **Adopt startup standards and practices.** This doesn’t have to be “move fast and break things.” It can be as simple as supporting personal and professional growth, or as complex as instituting an Agile methodology (which is probably a good idea in a tech-oriented team, anyway, but that’s for another resource).

If you can find a way to support a results-oriented workplace, in which your staff defines their own schedules, work habits and locations, vacations, and breaks, so much the better. At least [one study](http://discover.umn.edu/news/arts-humanities/flexible-schedules-and-results-oriented-work-environments-reduce-work-family) showed that a results-oriented workplace reduces turnover among employees, among other benefits.

Can you relax the dress code? Host potluck team lunches? Bring in outside experts who are willing to volunteer their time to teach your team something new? Modify your office to break people out of cubicles and encourage collaboration?

*   **Offer training:** Subscriptions to Treehouse and Lynda.com can give great results. But if you’re offering to pay for it, also offer _time_ for it. Your new employees may have the drive to teach themselves after-hours (in fact, they may expect to have to), but building in time for them to do this during office hours is a great way to encourage it. If you can, encourage conference attendance as well and make it easy for staff to attend.

Try the ‘see one, do one, teach one’ model. Let your existing practitioners teach anyone who’s interested and make time and space for that teaching to happen.

*   **On equipment:** Give your employees control over their own equipment. Yes, there are very good reasons to lock down an organization’s PCs, particularly among a group of less tech-savvy people. Nobody wants to be the person calling IT because they downloaded a virus. However, nobody wants to be the person calling IT every five minutes when they’re trying to run R or another data package and can’t because they don’t have admin rights over their desktops. This sort of control can have a chilling effect on data exploration.

If you can loosen those controls even a tiny bit, so that your data people can install software and run packages, you’ll make their jobs that much easier and more efficient, not to mention encourage them to explore what they can do with data. This is especially true for anyone building apps. At the very least, don’t firewall tools like Google Drive and other free web-based applications.

If you’re worried about viruses, see if you can get your team Macs instead of PCs. They’re a little more expensive, but they’re less prone to hardware and security issues. Plus, they can run Windows in parallel to their own operating system, if that’s a requirement.

*   **On policies**: If you think you can’t do something because “it’s against policy,” take another look at the actual language of the policy -- not the interpretation that’s been held as common wisdom. Does that policy actually say what you think it says? Is there a way to interpret it, or modify it, to support your end goal?

Todd Park, the former CTO of the United States, tells a story: For a very long time, a particular agency refused to use cloud services. The agency cited a policy that made the use of cloud services literally illegal. Turns out, the actual language of the policy didn’t say much of anything at all about cloud computing. Once that was cleared up, the agency was able to move onto a cloud infrastructure, which made their service-delivery jobs much more doable.
