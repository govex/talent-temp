##**Who are the ‘data people’?**

Think of the ‘data people’ as anyone with interest in understanding what’s happening in your organization (or the world) using quantifiable information. (This isn’t to say that behavioral interviews, textual analysis of written commentary, and verbal feedback aren’t quantifiable, but the discussion for qualitative versus quantitative is for another time.)

Data people do include analysts, number-crunchers, and budget people. But they also include GIS experts working with geospatial data, anyone who creates infographics, journalists, and storytellers.

* Data people may not have a policy background and that is okay.

* Data people may not have an accounting or statistics background and that is okay.

* Data people may not have a technical background and that is also okay.

Policy, statistics, data science, and technical skills can all be learned. What’s important when looking for these resources, first and foremost, is interest.
